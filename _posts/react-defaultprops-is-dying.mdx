React as we all know it, is changing. As a frontend developer with React experience for the past 3 years, selling me these changes was quite hard.  
I’m here today as the seller and not as the buyer, hoping I will catch you in the fever I got once I understood what’s behind all these changes :)

![Default props example](/assets/blog/react-defaultprops-is-dying/banner.png)

After the React team announced [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), and pushed functional components as a “solution for all our problems”, this thought ran in my head, why should we use React’s `defaultProps` and not ES6 Default values for functional components?  
Then I found this [RFC](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/107) that pretty much says what the React core team thinks about the idea

In this post I’ll cover my thoughts and share some performance conclusions.  
I’ll start with a simple explanation regarding `defaultProps` and ES6 Default Values. To avoid confusion, let’s decide to call React `defaultProps` React def. values and ES6 Default Values ES6 def. values. If you’re already familiar with the syntax, feel free to jump to the conclusions part.

### React def. values

Since React v15.5, runtime type checking for component’s props moved to a unified package called `prop-types`. This package gives us the ability to type check a component’s props and give it default values, for example lets look at a Greet component:

```jsx
const Greet = ({ firstName, lastName }) => {
  return <div>{`Hi ${firstName} ${lastName}`}!</div>;
};

Greet.propTypes = {
  firstName: PropTypes.string,
  lastName: PropTypes.string,
};
```

If we try to render Greet without giving it props:

```jsx
const Header = (props) => {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <Logo />
      <Greet />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
};
```

We will get something like this:

```
Hi undefined undefined!
```

`defaultProps` lets us avoid this scenario by setting default values to props:

```js
Greet.defaultProps = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
};
```

so when not passing the relevant props we will get:

```
Hi John Doe!
```

### ES6 def. values

Another option we can use in **functional components only**, is setting default values with ES6 Destructuring assignment syntax.  
Let’s take the Greet component we’ve created above and change it so it will contain default values.

```jsx
const Greet = ({ firstName = "John", lastName = "Doe" }) => {
  return <div>{`Hi ${firstName} ${lastName}`}!</div>;
};
```

As simple as that.  
So what should we use?

As everything is in programming, it’s a tradeoff, let’s see why.
