title: React will outlast us
excerpt: React has stayed at the center of frontend development for years, but in 2024 it crossed a threshold that few noticed. It's now become almost impossible to dethrone - and the reason has nothing to do with the React team, the ecosystem, or anything you'd expect.

I've been writing React code for almost a decade now. I've seen every cycle of panic, backlash, and "React is dead" prediction - honestly, it made me tired.  
But we've hit an inflection point, and it has nothing to do with the new `Activity` component or the long-awaited React Compiler.

I'm here to say: React has won because of something outside the React core team's control.  
And now, it won't just be hard to dethrone - it will be practically impossible.

## Why React dominated _before_ 2024?

People usually point to the same three reasons:

- **Ecosystem** - React has a very large community (a subreddit with almost 200k people) and a near-infinite amount of companion libraries and meta-frameworks (from component libraries to state management, Next.js, and many more).
- **Job market** - The job market favors React engineers in somewhat of a vicious cycle: companies are looking for React engineers because they build apps with React, and the cycle goes on where bootcamps only teach React.
- **Simplicity** - People tend to think that React's mental model is easy to grasp, even for beginners.

But, in 2024, something else happened.

## AI and The "Vibe Coding" Era

The AI shift started with GitHub Copilot in 2021: autocomplete, but smarter.  
Three years later, in November 2024, a small company called [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) launched something different - an _application generator_ - and kickstarted the term ["vibe coding"](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383).

That moment changed everything for React.

After Lovable's launch (and similar tools like Base44, Bolt, and v0), React's weekly downloads on npm almost doubled.  
I know, npm numbers may be inflated by CI/CD, but the trend is real: React is now approaching **50M downloads per week**.

Lovable, for example, clearly states that they chose React because:

> Lovable leverages React for several reasons, the most important being its popularity and ecosystem. React is the most widely adopted front-end library, with a vast developer community and extensive third-party support. This means that almost any UI challenge can be solved using existing React packages, saving time and effort in development.

Fine - expected. Then comes the more important line:

> large language models (LLMs) trained on code repositories can generate high-quality React code due to its dominance in online resources.

This is the real story.  
We've reached a point where LLMs favor React because they saw it so many times in their training data (be it tutorials, repos, boilerplates, blog posts, etc.), leading to another vicious cycle of creating more and more React applications.  
Let's play a little game. I tried the following prompt in ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Copilot: "Generate a UI for a todo app." Want to guess how many of them used React?  
You're right, 3/3 - all three models defaulted to React as the framework of choice. None of them chose Angular, Vue, Svelte, or plain HTML and JS.
Looking at the results of the [State of JS survey from 2024](https://2024.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/), we can see React leading in usage at 82%. Far behind, in second place, is Vue with 51% (!) and Angular with 50%.  
If we look on Stack Overflow, questions tagged with React (`reactjs`) are currently around 477k, where Angular is at 300k, Vue is at 100k, and Svelte is only at around 6k.  
Another data point can be taken from GitHub, where React has 29.8M dependent projects, Angular has 4M, and Svelte has 400k.

There's just no way to undo that.

## The Momentum Problem

Every new framework (hello Remix 3.0 👋) faces an impossible barrier:  
LLMs won't recommend, structure, or generate quality patterns for a tool that hasn't reached massive adoption. And they can't reach massive adoption **without** LLM amplification.

For example, here's a quote taken from Reddit in regards to Svelte 5:

> Most of them still don't get Svelte 5. … they either spit out old Svelte … or mess up the new syntax completely.

I know, you can enrich context with MCP (Context7) or tool-specific docs, but that only gets you so far. It doesn't change the underlying training-weight reality: React occupies far more of the internet's code corpus than anything else.

React isn't going anywhere.  
It will outlast every other frontend framework - even though the React team still claims it's not a framework.
