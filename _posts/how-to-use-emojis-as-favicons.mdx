If you wanted to use an Emoji as a favicon but wasn‚Äôt sure how to do it or if it‚Äôs supported, then here are all the details you need to know.

## Support

To simply use an emoji as a Favicon, we‚Äôll need to use an SVG as our Favicon. This is supported in all ever-green browsers besides **Safari**.

## Method

```html
<link
  rel="icon"
  type="image/svg+xml"
  sizes="any"
  href="data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22 viewBox=%220 0 100 100%22><text y=%22.9em%22 font-size=%2290%22>ü•¨</text></svg>"
/>
```

Adding this code snippet to your `head` section will give you a nice emoji favicon. Cool thing about this is that using `sizes="any"` gives us an option to support all resolutions and all sizes in just one line. This works only because we‚Äôre using `image/svg+xml` and SVG is ‚ÄúScalable Vector Graphic‚Äù.

Last but not least,
I hope everyone‚Äôs feeling well and keeping themselves safe!
