The “Container/Presentational” Pattern used to be the best practice when using redux or any other store management package.
It was explained thoroughly by [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) and [Michael Chan](https://twitter.com/chantastic).
If we want to keep it short, a `container` usually holds the data fetching logic and data access to store. On the other hand, a `presentational` component is more generic and just present the data it gets as `props`.
This pattern was common before React Hooks were introduced and probably every developer using React with classes has seen or used it.

But in the world of hooks, this approach can cause serious performance issues (we will cover those later on).  
Moreover, the [Redux best practices](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide#connect-more-components-to-read-data-from-the-store) now suggests we should connect more components to read directly from the store (which is quite the opposite to this pattern).

> “Prefer having more UI components subscribed to the Redux store and reading data at a more granular level. This typically leads to better UI performance, as fewer components will need to render when a given piece of state changes.” (The redux docs)

But, what’s the reason behind this rule?

## Our example app

I’ve built a small app with a sidebar fetching all the Pokemons (with a Select that decides how many Pokemons to fetch), and a right box showing the selected Pokemon. Clicking on a Pokemon name at the left, will change the image and fetch the relevant data.  
The UI looks like this:

In the first approach, I decided to use [`connect`](https://react-redux.js.org/api/connect) on a `container`, query all the data from the store and also `mapDispatchToProps` so I’ll be able to dispatch some data fetching.  
I passed the data to my components using props (the example uses styled-components but the actual styles were left behind):
